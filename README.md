# ma4n1-dirichlet-project

This project presents a formalisation of three special cases on Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. Specifically we have formalised the below theorems.
1. There are infinite primes of the form 4k+1
2. There are infinite primes of the form 6k+1
3. There are infinite primes of the form 8k+1
