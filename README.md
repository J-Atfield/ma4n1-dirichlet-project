# ma4n1-dirichlet-project

This project presents a formalisation of three special cases on Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions using Lean4. Specifically we have formalised the below theorems.
1. There are infinite primes of the form 4k+1
2. There are infinite primes of the form 6k+1
3. There are infinite primes of the form 8k+1
In doing so we have made wide use of Mathlib4 and many of the standard results available there. However, many of the facts we required for our version of the proof were unavailable and hence we have proven ourselves.
